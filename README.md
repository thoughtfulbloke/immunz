Script for reorganising quarterly New Zealand Ministry of Health Immunisation data.

Contains R code for downloading all relevant excel files, reorganising them, and the end csv output file


## Data Description

The csv file, containing a rearranged version of the original three monthly data sets of vaccination rates by DHB, from http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/immunisation/immunisation-coverage/national-and-dhb-immunisation-data contains the following 9 variables (columns):

### DHB

The DHB area. The 23 possible values are "Auckland", "Bay of Plenty", "Canterbury", "Capital & Coast", "Counties Manukau", "Hawkes Bay", "Hutt Valley", "Lakes", "Midcentral", "National", "Nelson Marlborough", "Northland", "Otago", "South Canterbury", "Southern", "Southland", "Tairawhiti", "Taranaki", "Waikato", "Wairarapa", "Waitemata", "West Coast", "Whanganui"

Otago and Southland were amalgamated into Southern in the time period covered. I have left the data as it is in the original sheets, but if analysing it you may wish to combine the Otago and Southland entries for the same time periods to artificially form Southern.

### Population

The number of 6 month olds in the time period of the excel file. If there are less than 10 and more than zero in a subgroup, then the number is suppressed.

### Full_IM

The number of 6 month olds fully vaccinated. If there are less than 10 and more than zero in a subgroup, then the number is suppressed.

### Rate

The Full_IM divided by the Population. The Rate is still given where individual entries are suppressed due to low numbers. The rate is not given where the Population is 0, as you cannot divide by 0.

### group

The subgroup of the DHB population being compared, possible values are:

* "Total" - The Total for the DHB area

* "Asian" - Asian vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Maori" - Maori vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "NZE" - New Zealand European vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Pacific" - Pacifica vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Other" - Other Ethnicity vaccination rate for the DHB area

* "Dep_1_&_2" - Deprivation Index 1 & 2 vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Dep_3_&_4" - Deprivation Index 1 & 2 vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Dep_5_&_6" - Deprivation Index 1 & 2 vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Dep_7_&_8" - Deprivation Index 1 & 2 vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Dep_9_&_10" - Deprivation Index 1 & 2 vaccination rate for the DHB area
* "Dep_Unavailable" - Unknown Deprivation Index households vaccination rate for the DHB area

### breakdown

There are two sections in the excel files, an ethnicity section and deprivation index section. This field notes which part the data came from. Possible values "ethnic" and "deprevation".
